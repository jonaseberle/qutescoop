Textures:
You can add textures here in all supported formats that get reported in 
log.txt.
Depending on your graphics card, it might be necessary that width and height 
are a power of 2 (1024, 2048, 4096...) pixels.
The Preferences Dialog will let you choose between all available textures.

log.txt will contain the error if there has been one while loading the 
texture.
